# Our process
To be taken care of: [HUMANAI]
time in your presentation, business case, learnings, evaluation, documentation


## Initial proposal
Initial proposal usecases extraction.
Challenges:
- not so 

"To build a model that is going to identify the use cases and related industry type inside a 
provided document based on an existing (internal) dataset of use cases

- time
- more or None topic per texts
- challenge of extracting part of text and weight similarities

## Updated proposal 
TO BE DEFINED:
Business Focus
Focus on buillding an NLP end-product &
business case with a demonstrator.

### Context
Look for relevant docs like:

Internet Articles Classification by Industry Types Based on TF-IDF
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-7605-3_179
In order to understand a specific industry field, people usually look at the financial statements of the companies relevant to the industry field. 
Financial statements have diverse and numerical information but have past financial states of companies because those are usually quarterly reported. So, needs to timely obtain the current states of an industry field is increasing. Proposed method is focusing on internet articles because they are easy to obtain and updated with new information every day. As a preliminary study of extracting information on industries from internet articles, this paper proposes a method to classify internet articles by industry types. The proposed method in this paper computes importance values of nouns in internet articles based on TF-IDF. Using calculated importance values, proposed method classifies articles by industry types. Through experiments, it is proven that proposed method can achieve high accuracy in industry article classification.

## Establishing context
